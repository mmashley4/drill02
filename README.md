drill02 serves as continued practice learning how to use Git and GitHub.

1. What is Git?
Git is a version control system. Think of it as a tool that tracks every change you make to files and lets you:
•	Go back to earlier versions.
•	See who made changes and when (even if it’s just you!).
•	Work on different ideas (branches) and then merge them together.
2. How it works (the simple mental model)
•	You have a repository — basically a folder that Git watches.
•	You make changes to files.
•	You "stage" changes (put them in a box and say “this is what I’m about to commit”).
•	You "commit" those changes (take a snapshot with a message explaining what you did).
•	You can see your full history and jump back in time.
