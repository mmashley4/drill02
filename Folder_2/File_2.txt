1.	Figure out what information you need and get it. Here, you need to develop the right relationships and ask the right questions
•	The best way to identify the information you need is to start with a winning proposal and work backwards to identify the information you need at each step

2.	Deliver the right information to the proposal. The information you gather must make it to the proposal in the proper format
•	This may mean using the information to answer questions and storing the answers
•	Or it could mean assessing the information to answer conclusions and storing those conclusions in a format that will help you produce the proposal

3.	Figure out what to do with the information you have. How does what you have learned impact what you know about what it will take to win? How should you translate the information into winning bid strategies and themes?
•	You must assess the data you collect  this assessment results in turning your information advantage into a competitive advantage
•	The best way to conduct this assessment is to look at it from different perspectives and see if it indicates how you should position yourself regarding the:
o	competitive environment
o	the customer’s preferences and needs
o	the evaluation criteria
o	utility
o	value
•	The bid strategies and themes must be turned into action items and carried forward

4.	Get it on paper. This is where you figure out what to say in your proposal 
•	Getting it on paper should be done in two steps:
o	Create a list that accounts for everything that needs to go into the proposal
o	Turn the itemized list into a narrative draft
	You need to untangle all of the RFP requirements and turn them into a Content Plan for the proposal
	When you have a Content Plan, then you are ready to figure out how to articulate and present a story based on what you have learned

5.	Get it delivered. Coordinating all the resources to get the proposal written and delivered on time is a major challenge
•	The right information needs to be identified and obtained
•	That information needs to be carried forward in a usable format in the proposal
•	That information needs to be turned into a plan so that the narrative draft accounts for all requirements
